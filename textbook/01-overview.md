Introduction
============

## Overview

### What is a compiler?
<!---
1.1.1 Definition of a Compiler
-->
A compiler translates from a source [language](#what-is-a-language) to a target language.

Examples:

- GCC, Clang, Visual C++ translate C into machine code
- LaTeX, Pandoc translate document markup into PDF, HTML, etc.

Follow-up:

- [How do compilers work](#what-are-the-phases-of-a-compiler)?
- [Who developed the first compiler](#who-was-grace-hopper)?

### What are the phases of a compiler?
Compilers consist of several distinct phases split among the front and back end.

![Phases of a compiler](images/compiler-phases.svg)

#### Front end
The front end processes the source language and consists of these phases:

- [Scanning (Lexical analysis)](#what-is-a-scanner). Split source code (a [string](#what-is-a-string)) into a token sequence.
- [Parsing (Syntactic analysis)](#what-is-a-parser). Check if token sequence conforms to language grammar and construct the [parse tree](#what-is-a-parse-tree) or [abstract syntax tree](#what-is-an-abstract-syntax-tree).
- [Type checking (Semantic analysis)](#what-is-a-type-checker). Check if the program is [semantically valid](#what-is-semantics).

#### Back end
The back end generates the target language and consists of these phases:

- [Translation](#what-is-a-translator). Convert an abstract syntax tree into an [intermediate representation](#what-is-an-intermediate-representation).
- [Analysis](#what-is-analysis). Collect information necessary for optimization.

- [Optimization](#what-is-optimization). Improve [intermediate representation](#what-is-an-intermediate-representation) code.
- [Code generation](#what-is-code-generation). Produce machine code from an intermediate representation or an [abstract syntax tree](#what-is-an-abstract-syntax-tree).

## Compiler and interpreters
<!---
1.1.3 Comparison between Compiler and Interpreter
-->

### What is an interpreter?
An interpreter reads in souce code and executes immediately without producing an executable.

#### Examples:

- Debuggers
- Scripting languages

#### Follow-up:

- [How do interpreters work](#how-do-interpreters-work)?
- [Which is better, compilers or interpreters](#which-is-better-compilers-or-interpreters)?

### How do interpreters work?
Interpreters share many [phases of a compiler](#what-are-the-phases-of-a-compiler), but execute instead of [generating machine code](#what-is-code-generation).
Interpreter implementations vary:

- Trivial interpreters execute code while parsing (e.g., early versions of Lisp, Python, Perl, Basic)
- Traditional interpreters omit the code generator, and execute the intermediate representation.
- Complex interpreters execute precompiled code as part of a compiler-interpreter system.

### Which is better, compilers or interpreters?
It depends.

Because an interpreter never produces an executable, interpreted code is always up to date.
However, an interpreter must process source code every time it executes, thus it can be slower than compiled machine code.

### The C compiler is in C; how can that be?
With the exception of the first C compiler, it is possible to write a C compiler in C and then compile it using another existing C compiler.
Writing the first C compiler in C required [bootstrapping](#what-is-bootstrapping-and-how-does-it-work).

### What is bootstrapping and how does it work?
Bootstrapping is a series of steps that slowly builds up a self-hosting compiler.

> TODO: expand this so to answer how it works.

## Theory of computation

### What is a language?
A [set](#what-is-a-set) of [strings](#what-is-a-string).
Typically, a [formal grammar](#what-is-a-grammar) defines the language.

Examples and counterexamples:

- "I love you dearly!" is in English.
- "Love I dearly you!" is not in English, despite the English words.
- "int main() { return 0; }" is in C.

### What is a grammar?
A grammar consists of:

- A set of [productions](#what-is-a-production).
- A set of terminals.
- A set of nonterminals.
- A start symbol (a nonterminal)

#### Example
This two production grammar (written in a variant of [Backus Naur Form](#what-is-backus-naur-form)) matches balanced parentheses.

$Parens \to (Parens)*$
$Parens \to [^()]*$

### What is a production?
A production, or rewriting rule, consists of a left hand side (LHS) and a right hand side (RHS).

$LHS \to RHS$

[Depending on the class of grammar](#what-is-chomskys-hierarchy), the left hand side and right hand side can be sequences of [terminals](#what-is-a-terminal) and [nonterminals](#what-is-a-nonterminal).

### What is a Nonterminal?
A nonterminal is anything in a grammar that can be replaced, and corresponds to [parent nodes](#what-is-a-parent-node) in a [parse tree](#what-is-a-parse-tree).

### What is a Terminal?
A terminal is a primitive unit in a grammar (a [symbol](#what-is-a-symbol) or [token](#what-is-a-token)) that corresponds to the [leaf nodes](#what-is-a-leaf-node) in a [parse tree](#what-is-a-parse-tree).
Terminal Symbols/Tokens cannot be broken down.
Example:
1. s can become sg
2. s can become gs
G is terminal because no rule can change the s.
S however is nonterminal because there are two rules that can modify the s in the lexical analysis portion.

### What is Chomsky's hierarchy?
The Chomsky hierarchy, as the name implies, is a containment hierarchy of classes of [formal grammars](#what-is-a-grammar).
The hierarchy consists of four levels:

1. [Unrestricted grammars](#what-is-an-unrestricted-grammar). Recognized by [Turing machines](#what-is-a-turing-machine).
2. [Context sensitive grammars](#what-is-a-context-sensitive-grammar). Recognized by a [bounded Turing machine](#what-is-a-bounded-turing-machine).
3. [Context-free grammars](#what-is-a-context-free-grammar). Recognized by a [pushdown automaton](#what-is-a-pushdown-automaton).
4. [Regular grammars](#what-is-a-regular-grammar). Recognized by a [finite state machine](#what-is-a-finite-automaton).

#### Follow-up questions
- [What are the implications of Chomsky's hierarchy](#what-are-the-implications-of-chomskys-hierarchy)?

### What are the implications of Chomsky's hierarchy?
The difference between regular, context-free, and context-sensitive languages is in the structure of strings.
The difference has nothing to do with meaning or semantics.

Context-sensitive
------------------
Rules are of the form:
    ?A? ? ?B?
    S ? ?
where
    A, S ? N
    ?, ?, B ? (N ? ?)?
    B ? ?

Context-free
------------------
Rules are of the form:
   A ? ?
where
   A ? N
   ? ? (N ? ?)?

Regular
------------------
Rules are of the form:
  A ? ?
  A ? ?
  A ? ?B
where 
  A, B ? N and ? ? ?

### What is an unrestricted grammar?
An unrestricted grammar's productions can include sequences of terminals and nonterminals in both the left and right hand sides of productions.

### What is a context-sensitive grammar?
> TODO: define context-sensitive here.
Why does more than one symbol on the left hand side make a language context free?

In order to explain this lets look at some grammar in which that occurs.

$A\to h$
$B\to k$
$AB \to Asd$

Now if we look at the language and we have AB, do we mean that we have A and B or do we mean that we have AB?
This cannot be determined simply by just using the rules of the grammar.
We would need other information.
This means that the language is not context free.

1.1.2.2 Purpose  
As we mention in the definition of the compiler is to translate the source language to a source language, so, the purpose of the compiler will be to make these high lever languages easy for the computer to understand because the computer only understand the 0 and 1. In addition, a compiler will let to communicate with hardware.

#### Object Code and Executables
> Let first define each of Source code, Object code and Executable and then later we can talk about how they work with the compiler.
Source Code: is the code that the programmers write it and run it on his/her machines.
Executable Code: is the code that runs on your machines, which is usually linked to the source code.
Last, Object Code: is act as the transitional form between the source code and the Executable code.
